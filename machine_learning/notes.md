Machine Learning (ML)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Definition
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to automatically learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed. Instead of relying on fixed rules, ML algorithms improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Types of Machine Learning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Machine learning is broadly divided into three main types:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. Supervised Learning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Definition:
        In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from a labeled dataset, where both the input data (features) and the output data (labels/targets) are provided.
        The goal is to predict outcomes for new, unseen data.

    Main tasks:

        Classification → Predicting a category/class (discrete values).

        Regression → Predicting a numeric/continuous value.

    Examples:

        Classification:

            Spam email detection (spam / not spam).

            Disease diagnosis (positive / negative).

            Handwritten digit recognition (digits 0–9).

        Regression:

            Predicting house prices based on features like location, size, and rooms.

            Forecasting stock prices.

            Predicting temperature.

    Real-world case:

        Netflix predicting whether a user will like a movie (classification).

        Uber predicting the estimated fare of a ride (regression).

    2. Unsupervised Learning
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Definition:
        In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is given unlabeled data (only inputs, no outputs). The system tries to find hidden patterns, structures, or relationships in the data.

    Main tasks:

        Clustering → Grouping similar data points together.

        Dimensionality Reduction → Simplifying datasets by reducing the number of features while keeping important information.

    Examples:

        Clustering:

            Customer segmentation in marketing (grouping customers by behavior).

            Document clustering (grouping news articles by topic).

            Image segmentation (separating different objects in a picture).

        Dimensionality Reduction:

            Reducing noise in image recognition.

            Data visualization using PCA (Principal Component Analysis).

            Compressing datasets for faster training.

    Real-world case:

        Spotify grouping songs into playlists based on similarity.

        E-commerce websites segmenting users to recommend products.

    3. Reinforcement Learning (RL)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Definition:
        Reinforcement learning is a type of ML where an agent learns by interacting with an environment. The agent takes actions and receives rewards (positive or negative feedback). Over time, it learns the best strategy (policy) to maximize rewards.

    Key components:

        Agent → Learner/decision-maker.

        Environment → The system the agent interacts with.

        Actions → Choices the agent can make.

        Rewards → Feedback from the environment.

    Examples:

        Training a robot to walk by giving rewards when it moves correctly.

        Self-driving cars learning safe driving strategies.

        Game AI (e.g., AlphaGo, which beat human champions in the game Go).

        Online advertising systems deciding which ads to show for maximum clicks.

    Real-world case:

        Google DeepMind’s AlphaZero learned to play chess and Go better than any human by trial-and-error.

        Amazon using RL to optimize warehouse robot movements.
